X-Plane-Teensy-UFCP
===================

Arduino source code, PCB layouts and full documentation on a Teensy++ based Autopilot panel for fighters in X-Plane 10.30
The code is designed to be able to run on both X-Plane 9.70 and on X-Plane 10.30 simulators.
Unfortunately, the detarefs are not compatible in the two versions, so You will have to 
program the microcontroller for your specific version of the simulator in order to get the code working.

Current missing features:
-Character LCD support
-Command evaulation fro the numerical keypad inputs
-Weapon mode selector.
-VNAV support
